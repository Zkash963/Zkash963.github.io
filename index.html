         <p>I am a sophomore at Bob Jones University studying Accounting. I'm originally from east Africa but I live in Columbia, South Carolina.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy playing soccer, and I am on the bruins men's soccer team. I'm a winger as a position on the soccer field. I prefer playing on the left side of the field.
